Hoya Hacks 2016 Project

# What is it
RunThruIt helps you run smarter. Track your goals, runs, workouts, weight, water intake and more. It even tracks the mileage on your running shoes and alerts you to when they are worn out and need replacing. It can also preemptively alert you before a possible injury, if you aren't getting enough sleep or even drinking enough fluids. You can also publish your workouts to the public RunThruIt feed at [runthruit.net](http://runthruit.net)

# Download
Visit the [releases](https://github.com/theryan722/RunThruIt/releases) page to download the binary.

# Future Plans
In the future I plan on adding the ability to extract information from GPS watches, fitbits, etc. as well as a scheduling and meetup feature.
