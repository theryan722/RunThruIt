Hoya Hacks 2016 Project

#What is it
RunThruIt helps track your goals, runs, workouts, weight, water intake and more. It even tracks the mileage on your running shoes and alerts you to when they are worn out and need replacing. It can also preemptively warn you before you get injured. You can also publish your workouts to the public RunThruIt feed at [runthruit.net](http://runthruit.net)
